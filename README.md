This repository allows you to exchange test cases among each other to debug your programs. In the end, we will grade with test cases much like the ones from here (and including some exactly from here) to run against everyone's program. Therefore, the trickier the test, the better. 

There will be a directory for each homework. Please create a subdir with your bi-co user name in the corresponding directory, and post all your test cases there.

Happy coding!!
